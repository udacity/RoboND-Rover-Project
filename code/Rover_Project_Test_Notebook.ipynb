    "* Run the simulator in \"Training Mode\" and record some data. Note: the simulator may crash if you try to record a large (longer than a few minutes) dataset, but you don't need a ton of data, just some example images to work with.   \n",
    "* Change the data directory path (2 cells below) to be the directory where you saved data\n",
    "* Test out the functions provided on your data\n",
    "* Write new functions (or modify existing ones) to report and map out detections of obstacles and rock samples (yellow rocks)\n",
    "* Populate the `process_image()` function with the appropriate steps/functions to go from a raw image to a worldmap.\n",
    "* Run the cell that calls `process_image()` using `moviepy` functions to create video output\n",
    "* Once you have mapping working, move on to modifying `perception.py` and `decision.py` to allow your rover to navigate and map in autonomous mode!\n",

You can investigate the colors of the rocks (the RGB pixel values) in an interactive matplotlib window to get a feel for the appropriate threshold range (keep in mind you may want different ranges for each of R, G and B!).  Feel free to get creative and even bring in functions from other libraries.
